## What does it do?
Sendroid helps you to easily send selected text or links right from your browser to your android device. And then you can directly share them from notification with your favorite sharing app.

Remember the times when you were browsing internet and came across a funny image in 9gag or an interesting article in some blog and you wanted to share that with your friends through Whatsapp/Viber/Line/Hike? You either had to download image in PC, transfer to android or mail it to yourself and download in android or had to use some application that requires you to login and stores your data in their server.

Sendroid comes to the rescue.
Sendroid enables you to...

- Send text or links to your android device with a simple right click on your browser in PC.
- Share the recieved text/link or open the received link in browser directly from the notification.
- Download and share images directly from the notification if the received link is of an image.

All this without asking you to sign in for any service or open the app ever (except the first time). As icing on the cake, Sendroid does not store your data in any server (except Google cloud server, which Sendroid does not have access to).
